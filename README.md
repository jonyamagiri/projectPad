## projectPad

> ProjectPad is a web app for lab project management that enables users to create and manage notes for their experiments with a strong focus on efficient workflow. The platform streamlines lab project management and helps users manage their notes and related information systematically and conveniently. The target users for the web app include students, researchers, lab assistants, and professionals who need to document and organize their lab projects' progress and results.

* This capstone project was developed as part of the requirements for the Holberton School's foundation in software engineering program. The timeline for the project was two weeks from conception to delivery of the MVP.

### Features
ProjectPad has four key features that make it an intuitive and efficient tool for lab project management:

**Effortless Note-Taking:** Users can effortlessly create and manage notes for their experiments. The app provides a user-friendly interface for note-taking, making it easy to document and organize lab projects' progress and results.
