                The inspiration for the ProjectPad web app stemmed from my experience as a research scientist who struggled to
                keep track of my lab notes. As part of <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/"
                    target="_blank">Holberton School's</a> foundation in software engineering program, I was tasked with
                creating a Portfolio Project within a two-week timeline. Thus, I conceptualized and developed ProjectPad to meet
                the program's requirements while addressing a common problem among lab professionals and students.

                ProjectPad is designed to assist individuals involved in lab projects who require a systematic and efficient way
                to manage notes and related information. The web app caters to a diverse group of users, including students,
                researchers, lab assistants, and professionals who need to document and organize their lab projects' progress
                and results. The app's accessibility and convenience benefit users who have difficulty physically accessing
                their notes or need to collaborate with others remotely. Additionally, the app's efficient project management
                and streamlined workflow cater to users who have limited time or resources to dedicate to note-taking and
                organization.

                In just two weeks, I successfully delivered the MVP for ProjectPad, and I am proud of the effort and dedication
                I invested in this project. As a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, ProjectPad showcases my skills in
                software engineering, project management, and problem-solving, and I look forward to developing it further in
                the future.
